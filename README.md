<h1> A Visualization About Meteorite Strikes Across the Globe </h1>
<p>In this project, I wanted to explore how we can transform our data and visualize it captivatingly.</p>
<h3>Tools used in this project</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Processing</li>
  <li>Excel</li>
  <li>Inkscape</li>
</ol>
<p>In traditional data visualizations, I could have opted to use some of the popular tools like Tableau or power-bi, but to capture the audience's attention quickly maybe we have to try something more visually appealing
</p>
<p>The data was in a CSV format and was already cleaned the only extra step was to arrange the data descendingly based on the meteor's mass</p>
<p>The following steps were reading the data into processing, then plotting the data points on the world map that I have loaded as well.</p>
